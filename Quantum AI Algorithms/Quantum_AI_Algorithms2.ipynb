The superposition state helps to reduce complexity of search in quantum algorithms. The quantum search algorithms are proportional to /M queries. Quantum search is modeled using wave-like amplitudes and interference concepts. Quantum search identifies a sequence of quantum logic gates that finds a solution to a real-life problem. The algorithm is proportional to the amplitude of the particular time in context. Quantum search algorithms are popular and solve many real-life problems."],"metadata":{"id":"JxA4Ut6im4ZR"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Quantum Deep Learning**\n","\n","The quantum computation framework, based on the Boltzmann machine, helps to provide a quantum deep learning framework. The framework helps in the process of learning and training the machine learning models. Quantum machine learning is based on the quantum data and hybrid quantum classical models. The quantum data model is based on the quantum data source and uses the quantum computerâ€“generated data. The model is based on the superposition and entanglement principles. A Hilbert space of 2^53 elements that represents joint probability distribution can be solved using a quantum computer. A Quantum Tensor Flow framework has the infrastructure concepts to create machine learning models that can use the quantum data models and algorithms. A quantum neural network is one of the techniques that is based on the parameterized quantum computational model."],"metadata":{"id":"W0zlMj0in3rK"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","**Variational Quantum Eigensolver**\n","\n","A variational quantum eigensolver is about identifying the eigenvalues of certain operators. Eigen value identification is a complex and challenging problem. The quantum phase estimation method can be applied to compute the eigenvalue \n","of a given eigenvector. You can optimize a variational circuit in lowering the squared energy expectation of a user-defined Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian can be expressed as a sum of two Pauli operators."],"metadata":{"id":"O-miYxhLpKtL"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pennylane as quantumDeepL\n","from pennylane import numpy as npython\n","from pennylane.optimize import GradientDescentOptimizer as GDOpt"],"metadata":{"id":"qshPxbzmqOD5","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1651493113483,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":6099,"user":{"displayName":"Werner Vermeulen","userId":"03124494664443879618"}}},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"id":"YPaVF7yLm3PN","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1651493134408,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":591,"user":{"displayName":"Werner Vermeulen","userId":"03124494664443879618"}},"outputId":"eca1eb52-ae2e-4584-ddad-3d67cfcf35e2"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/pennylane/_grad.py:104: UserWarning: Attempted to differentiate a function with no trainable parameters.
