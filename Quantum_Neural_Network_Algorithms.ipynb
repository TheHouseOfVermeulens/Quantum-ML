A new model was created by Wichita State University that is based on the spatial model of QNN. The spatial model uses the array of quantum dot molecules. Ron Chrisley, who was based in the University of Sussex, has proposed a different approach related to the network weights that are dependent on the position of silts. A quantum neural network that is based on neurocomputing is used for pattern recognition in real life.

A generator is used to create statistics for data. It tries to mimic the current data set. A discriminator differentiates between the real and fake data. The learning process for a generator and a discriminator converges. The convergence happens when the generator generates the statistics. At the same time, the discriminator cannot differentiate between the real and generated data.\n","\n","The quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) are generative adversarial\n","networks using quantum processors.
