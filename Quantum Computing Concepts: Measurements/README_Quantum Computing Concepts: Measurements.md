In Quantum Computing Concepts: Measurements

• Single-qubit measurements. Learn what quantum measurement is and how to use it for single-qubit systems.

• Measurements. Learn to distinguish quantum states using measurements.

• Distinguish unitaries*. Learn to distinguish unitaries by designing and performing experiments with them.

• Joint measurements*. Learn about using joint (parity) measurements to distinguish quantum states and to perform state transformations.
