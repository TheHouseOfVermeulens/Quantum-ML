Below is a compact Python-style pseudocode snippet that represents the AI‑Enhanced Quantum Economic–Managerial Framework (AI‑QEMF) at micro, meso, and macro levels. It is not an operational trading system, but a conceptual illustration consistent with the thesis (formal quantum probability, AI mediation, ethical reflexivity, and tri‑level integration) [[34]].

# The code is a conceptual scaffold: it uses formal quantum probability (Hilbert‑space amplitudes, projectors) for micro‑level cognition, but runs on classical hardware.
#`QuantumCognitiveState` captures contextuality and order effects tested via the QQ model in the empirical study.
# `AIMediator` treats AI as a meso‑level agential layer with ethics built into its core logic rather than as an external overlay.
# `MarketSystem` represents markets as complex adaptive, self‑reflective systems, consistent with chaos/complexity and quantum‑inspired perspectives.
