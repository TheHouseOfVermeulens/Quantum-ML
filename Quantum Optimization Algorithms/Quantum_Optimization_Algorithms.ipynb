Approximate combinatorial optimization helps in finding a solution closer to the optimum value quickly. This technique may not give the best solution, however. This method helps in finding a short path for a traveling salesman problem. \n","\n","\n","\n"," Dynamic programming can be used for this problem by breaking it down into subproblems. Start at the first city, and for all other cities, create a subproblem starting from the new city. These subproblems will create a recursion to identify the cheapest travel itinerary for the salesperson. The approximate optimization algorithm calculates the optimal itinerary by finding the cost of the minimum spanning tree. A minimum spanning tree is a subgroup of the connected path of the cities without having cycles and lesser total edge cost.
