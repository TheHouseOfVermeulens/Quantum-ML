# Quantum-ML
Thank you for following my journey in Quantum ML. 
The future is Quantum and this is a collection of my QML including some of my Doctoral research.
In this repo I solve Quantum Katas Online with Jupyter Notebooks, analyse the Titanic dataset using QML from PyQML and end with doctoral and post-doctoral research. Enjoy!
