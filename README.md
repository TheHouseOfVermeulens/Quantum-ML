# Quantum-ML
Thank you for following my venture into Quantum ML. 
The future is Quantum and this is a collection of my QML learning, including some of my Doctoral and post-doctoral research.
In this repo I solve Quantum Katas Online with Jupyter Notebooks in Q#, analyse the Titanic dataset from PyQML, solve real world problems using Cirq, Qiskit, PennyLane and other open source Quantum ML libraries available in Github. I end this repo with doctoral and post-doctoral research. Enjoy!
